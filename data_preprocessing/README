In this folder we provide the code and tutorials how to extract control flow, data flow graph from the executible file.


## Prepare the CFG with Angr
1. Install Angr. In our work we use the 8.9.7.25 verion.
2. Install the angr-util and bingraphviz by source code
        cd angr-dev
        git clone https://github.com/axt/bingraphvis
        pip install -e ./bingraphvis
        git clone https://github.com/axt/angr-utils
        pip install -e ./angr-utils
3. Install all the dependencies, such as pyvex, pygraphviz. Here use pip install
4. Please replace the same files with our replacing files in replace_file folder.
5. Prepare the executible file and then put them into the suitable folder.
   For example, put the executible files under ../angr-dev/angr-utils/examples/scfg_winpe_new/samples
6. run the script files in the same folder with execuitable files. 
   In our case, that is ../angr-dev/angr-utils/examples/scfg_winpe_new/run.sh
7. There are three new Termin will appeared, and the ".cfg" will generate as the final output of this part of code
